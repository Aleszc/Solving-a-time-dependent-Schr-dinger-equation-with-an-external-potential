# Solving-a-time-dependent-Schr-dinger-equation-with-an-external-potential
This program solves a time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation using Crank-Nicolson method.
1. First set simulation's parameters such as: total time, time step, wave vector step etc.
2. The code computes wavefunction's form over set time
3. Creation of gifs visualising probability denisty and imaginary/real part of the wavefunction over set time with a potential step (which value can be adjusted by changing initial paramteres)
